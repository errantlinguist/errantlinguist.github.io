				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Air traffic control is by no means an easy task: Directing multiple aircraft through a huge, three-dimensional airspace simultaneously involves a lot of work and there is no room for error. Therefore, a number of people are developing more-advanced technology in order to enable controllers to do their jobs more efficiently and safely. One example of such is the arrival management software <a href="http://www.dlr.de/fl/Portaldata/14/Resources/dokumente/Veroeffentlichungen/AT-One3_-4D-CARMA.pdf">4D-CARMA</a> from <a href="http://www.dlr.de/">the German Aerospace Center</a>. An arrival managers (AMAN) is a system used by controllers to plan aircraft arrivals and to monitor their progress according to an arrival plan already determined for the day. In this particular case, natural-language understanding is is being developed for such software in order to allow the system to understand and process commands given by controllers to aircraft on approach so that many tasks once performed manually by the controller can be done automatically.</p>
