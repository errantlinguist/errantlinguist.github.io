		<p class="nomargin">My interests lie primarily within situated human-machine interaction and dialogue &mdash; namely, in utilising situational knowledge about the context in which such interaction is performed to enhance the interaction. All language (as well as dialogue in general) is situated in context, and the ability to reason about and condition for such situational and contextual knowledge can be put to great use in natural language understanding and processing.</p>
		<p>In this regard, some specific topics of research I like to follow are situated dialogue and dialogue systems as well as context-sensitive classification, multi-modal interaction and human-machine interaction in general.</p>
