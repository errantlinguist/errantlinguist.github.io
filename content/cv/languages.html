<p class="nomargin">My native language is English, but I also speak German fluently (certified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages">C1-level</a> proficiency from the <a href="http://www.goethe.de/">Goethe Institute</a>) and I haven't yet forgotten all of the Russian I'd learnt in university and while living in St Petersburg.</p>
<p>Moreover, being a linguist, I've studied a few languages for the purpose of linguistic analysis and/or for sheer fun; Of all these, it might be worth mentioning that I used to know a bit of Spanish, and I have at least theoretical knowledge of Norwegian.</p>
