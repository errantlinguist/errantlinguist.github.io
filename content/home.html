	<h3 id="aboutme">About me</h3>
	<p>I'm a software engineer with a background in computational linguistics, which entails using computer science methods as a means for processing human language as an end, ultimately to enable machines to "understand" language. In order to accomplish this, methods from various fields are used, such as from machine learning, search algorithms and mathematical optimisation as well as e.g. data and knowledge representations, graph theory and data processing and storage.</p>
	<p>Previously, I'd finished post-graduate studies in computational linguistics, my thesis work focusing on using situational knowledge to improve classification in a dynamic context; The type of classification was speech recognition and the context it was used in was an air traffic control simulation, as part of a larger project with the <a href="http://www.dlr.de/">German Aerospace Center</a>, a.k.a. <i>das Deutsche Zentrum f&uuml;r Luft- und Raumfahrt</i> (DLR). My work was done at the <a href="http://www.lsv.uni-saarland.de/">Department of Spoken Language Systems</a> at Saarland University in Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany.</p>
	<p>Not surprisingly, my research interests lie primarily within situated human-machine interaction and dialogue &mdash; namely, in utilising situational knowledge about the context in which such interaction is performed to enhance the interaction: All language (as well as dialogue in general) is situated in context, and the ability to reason about and condition for such situational and contextual knowledge can be put to great use in natural language understanding and processing.</p>
	<p>In this regard, some specific topics of research I like to follow are situated dialogue and dialogue systems as well as context-sensitive classification, multi-modal interaction and human-machine interaction in general. Moreover, although language-based (especially dialogue-based) issues are my speciality, I find many search- and optimisation-related problems to be interesting.</p>
	<p>Outside of my professional life, I like hiking and cycling as well as travel and outdoor sports in general (time and money permitting).</p>
	<h3>Public files</h3>
	<p>You may find a few interesting things in the <a href="http://errantlinguist.com/public/">public files section</a> including papers of mine, photos I've taken and code I've written (a few more bits and bobs may be available at my <a href="https://github.com/errantlinguist">GitHub page</a>). Please be nice and don't blatantly take stuff from my site and credit yourself for it; If it's not explicitly open-source, just ask me if you can use it: I'm a rather nice person and so I'll likely let you. Also please note that this stuff is updated rather infrequently.</p>
	<h3>Blog</h3>
	<p>I (not exactly regularly) maintain a small <a href="http://errantlinguistblog.wordpress.com/">blog</a> devoted to questions in computational linguistics/NLP and about life as a computational linguist in general.</p>
